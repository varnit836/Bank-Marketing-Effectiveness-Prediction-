# Bank-Marketing-Effectiveness-Prediction-
In this project I will  Predict the effectiveness of bank marketing campaigns using Machine learning classification model.
At first I perform exploratory data analysis using feature/column of the dataset. Also I have created some new feature by using existing feature.
Used Correlation graph to finalise the feature for machine learning model.
Machine learning model created in the notebbook are Logistic regeression, Random forest, KNN, SVC, LGBM, LGBM (Hyperparameter Tunned).
